# Howl3D-UI
A frontend for [Howl3D](https://github.com/Irastris/Howl3D) utilizing the Avalonia framework.

⚠️ **Extremely WIP** ⚠️

The code in this repository does not yet actually function as a frontend for Howl3D. Unlike Howl3D, which is written in a language I have almost a decade of experience with, I have only dabbled with C# for a couple of years now, and more importantly have never used Avalonia before. As such, this repository's commit history will likely contain significant off-topic work done simply to familiarize myself with both.
